# Visual Time Capsule
Visual Time Capsules enable users and their friends to save safe-keep their precious memories and aspirations and send them to your future selves.

## Features
 - The system allows users to create accounts and link to their friends and create time capsules containing their memories - text, image, video or audio files.
 - Each capsule or group of capsules can have a goal associated with it that can be marked as completed upon opening the capsule.
 - Each capsule can be either short-term or long-term and can be either personal or shared.
 - Users are also able to create groups of capsules around a common theme.
